# Web Scraping from an Online Store

![Web scraping logo](web_scraping_logo.png)

Welcome to the "Web Scraping from an Online Store" project! This project is designed to extract information from an online store by parsing its web pages. It searches for details about the seller and gathers their data, as well as collects information about all the products they sell.

## How It Works

1. **Seller Information Extraction**: The web scraping script navigates through the web pages of the online store, identifying sections or elements that contain information about the seller. It extracts relevant data such as the seller's name, contact information, location, and any additional details available.

2. **Product Data Collection**: The script further explores the web pages to locate and extract information about the products offered by the seller. It scans product listings, including titles, descriptions, prices, and other relevant attributes. This data is collected and organized for further analysis or usage.

3. **Data Storage**: The extracted seller information and product data are stored in a structured format, such txt file. This allows for easy access, retrieval, and manipulation of the gathered information for various purposes.
